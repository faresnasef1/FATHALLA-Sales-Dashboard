A sunburst chart visualizes sales performance across different categories and their respective sub-categories, allowing for a deeper level of analysis.

Bar charts clearly identify the top 10 and bottom 10 products, providing actionable insights for inventory and marketing strategies.

### Data-Driven Insights: 
The visualizations are designed to support data-driven decision-making, helping to optimize sales strategies and improve overall business performance.

### Technical Skills Applied
Microsoft Excel: Utilized advanced Excel functionalities, including a variety of charts (sunburst, bar), and data tables to build the dashboard.
